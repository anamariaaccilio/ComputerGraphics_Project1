# Description of the proyect
HDR is defined by Cooper in 2014 as'a computer program, a photograph that has been processed by an HDR program, or the technique of taking multiple photographs with the intention of blending them together in an HDR program.' Marschner complements this definition by adding that 'an HDR image may be generated by capturing multiple images of the same scene at different exposure levels and merging them to reconstruct the original dynamic range of the captured scene.' (2021)



About the definition, **dynamic range** refers to the amount of separation between the brightest and darkest parts of a scene (it would have a limited range of brightness tones, too). 
The intention to use HDR is capture full detail in a scene that contains very bright and dark areas, in other words, when the brightness or darkness exceeds the camara's capability to capture it.
